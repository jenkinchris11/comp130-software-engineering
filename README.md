Proposal - My question is - How can developers help in the proccess of making games more accessible to people with disabillities.

My question will be how can developers help to make games more accessible to people who still want to play games but are not able to do so in the same way as a normal gamer, an example would be if someone only had one arm how could developers help in the process of making the game so that it is more accessible.
